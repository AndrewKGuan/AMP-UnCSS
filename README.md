## Assumptions

- All input files are AMPed .html files
- Input files include exactly (2) `<style amp-boilerplate>` elements. Any additional `<style>` 
  elements will be consolidated into a single, optimized, `<style amp-custom>` element. 
- HTML Parsing: Due to the dynamic nature of certain AMP components such as`<amm-image>` and 
`<amp-livelist>`, a virtual browser will need to be instantiated to guarantee correct optimizations.
  - Type 0 and Type 1 optimizations operate with a simple static DOM parser
  - Type 2 optimizations will require a full browser instance (via Puppeteer) and will require 100x 
  the amount of time to complete.
