# AMP UnCSS âš¡

AMP-UnCSS is a way to tree-shake unused CSS from complete AMP HTML documents. It is our attempt at alleviating the work required to manually clean up CSS styles in order to meet the AMP HTML 50KB CSS limit.

## Installation Instructions

#### For use with Webpack

1. Install via NPM

``$ npm install --save amp-uncss``

2. Configure Webpack to include AMP-UnCSS plugin

#### Chrome Extension

## Assumptions

- All input files are AMPed .html files
- Input files include exactly (2) `<style amp-boilerplate>` elements. Any additional `<style>` 
  elements will be consolidated into a single, optimized, `<style amp-custom>` element. 
- HTML Parsing: Due to the dynamic nature of certain AMP components such as`<amm-image>` and 
`<amp-livelist>`, a virtual browser will need to be instantiated to guarantee correct optimizations.
  - Type 0 and Type 1 optimizations operate with a simple static DOM parser
  - Type 2 optimizations will require a full browser instance (via Puppeteer) and will require 100x 
  the amount of time to complete.

## Git Workflow

Note: Local repo contains 'master' and working branches. Origin repo contains 'master', 'dev', 'KES_dev', & 'AKG_dev'

1. ``master: git pull --rebase origin dev``
2. ``master: git checkout -b <working-branch-name>``
3. Do work and testing here.
4. ``<working-branch-name>: git add (. / file-names)``
5. ``<working-branch-name>: git commit -m "<commit message>``
6. ``<working-branch-name: git checkout master``
7. ``master: git pull --rebase upstream dev``
8. Fix merge conflicts.
9. Commit merge conflicts.
10. ``master: git push origin <AKG||KES>_dev``
11. Create merge request from ``<AKG||KES>_dev`` to ``dev``. Assign other contributer to review merge.
